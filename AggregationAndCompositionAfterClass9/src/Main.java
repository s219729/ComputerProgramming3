//9.	A files system is a way of storing data on a storage device.
// The data is organised in computer files and folders.
// A folder is a container, where many files can be placed.
// Create a class diagram that shows classes for a folder and file, their attributes and methods,
// and their relationships. Assume that a folder can contain any number of files and does not contain other folders.
// Then, define the classes, their attributes and methods. To store any number of files in a folder,
// you can use a resizable array such as ArrayList. Finally, write a program that:
//a.	Create a folder
//b.	Add two files to the folder
//c.	Display the folder contents
//d.	Add another file to the folder
//e.	Display the folder contents
//f.	Remove the named file from the folder
//g.	Display the folder contents

// TIP: a, b, c, d, e, f, g – utworzyć w klasie Main



public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
